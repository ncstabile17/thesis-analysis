## Overview
This analysis is in fulfillment of my thesis requirement for a Master of Public Policy at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy.

In my thesis, I will be exploring the relationship between new housing production, rental prices, and housing cost burden in Washington, DC. As part of this analysis, I'll also be examining related investments in housing and economic development including mortgage loans and affordable housing. I will be producing maps and figures to visualize trends in variables related to my topic, which will be updated here as my work progresses.
